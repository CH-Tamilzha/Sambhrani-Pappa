# Github Pages

I came to know about Github Pages from my friend [@samcodee](https://github.com/samcodee), he has some amazing repos, go check him out!

You can use it to host your website online using Github.

For more details visit [Github Pages's Official Documentation](https://pages.github.com).

Overall, Github Pages is just amazing!

Oh! By the way, the very code(README file/text, not code, silly me) you are reading right now is hosted using Github Pages, visit [https://ch-tamilzha.github.io/Github-Pages/](https://ch-tamilzha.github.io/Github-Pages/) to view the hosted site. (If you are seeing this from my website please kindly ignore this)

Buh Bye!
